1
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:10,767
Yes, on location flying a few kilometers away from the skies of Port Edwards... Oh, we’re live?

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,400
A lot of black smoke is rising from Port Edwards. In the skies above it,

3
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:19,733
the shapes of countless fighters that sortied from both the Neucom and General Resource corporations’ bases are... oh!

4
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:23,567
It’s another explosion! What a dreadful sound that was! Everyone, if my voice reaches...

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Yes, this is the studio. To sum up the reports here once more, we will repeat that.

6
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:37,667
This afternoon, at Port Edwards, USEA, General Resource and Neucom have broken into a state of hostilities.

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:47,633
And that battle is still ongoing. The NUN—the Neo United Nations, in order to resolve the situation, has decided to dispatch UPEO’s peacekeeping forces...

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,100
On General Resource-affiliated news outlets,

9
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:57,300
there was an announcement that at present, keyword censorship for broadcast contents has been included in delivery systems.

10
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,567
A large-scale restriction of the press like this being enforced is a first.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,233
This current program is being broadcast from an independent personal base station.

12
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:12,333
That being the case, here you will see our independently-received images uncensored.

13
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:24,533
We already possess the technology for the purpose of allowing all mankind to exceed its limits, and are preparing it. 

14
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:37,100
—cast aside the flesh! This is a revolution done to set lives free. And now, we will declare.

15
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:50,133
Sublimation of all mankind—that is the one and only truth that will advance our lives into a new generation!

16
00:01:50,167 --> 00:02:02,933
This technology is not a dream. Perhaps we should show you a piece of evidence. —Dision!

17
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:10,867
This man, due to a General Resource trick 10 years ago, completely lost his flesh.

18
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:19,400
...and yet, as a life in the Electrosphere, he certainly exists even now.

19
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:31,133
Indeed, the “Will”, organized by the powers that came to be called by the names of “Life”, “Mind”, and “Consciousness” which we all equally hide from the start,

20
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:36,467
made not a limit of the frail existence known as Flesh and such, after all.

21
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:45,867
And this truth we came to hand down as information from prehistoric times.

22
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:57,600
We need not look back to history——. As for the existence of Life without the limit of Flesh, we transformed in this way.

23
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:12,100
That is, “the new image of mankind.” And so, above human history, Dision was reborn into the first life without flesh.

24
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:20,700
We install him as the Leader of the Beginning, and put this revolution into action!

25
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,967
Well now, let us, we the Ouroboros, introduce our leader, Abyssal Dision.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,533
Our rise to action, many people still seem to be misunderstanding.

27
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:42,767
Certainly, the things people are seeing at the present point are little more than that mutual killing so familiar to mankind, after all.

28
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:52,167
However, that is all we shall say for now. The forces that the organizations known as General Resource, Neucom, and UPEO and

29
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,933
the war they carry out even now, are the entrances for the revolution we hope for.

30
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:07,533
Indeed, for us, the true enemies are not the powers known as General Resource and Neucom, much less UPEO and such.

31
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:16,200
When this revolution is complete, what we, no, all mankind will grasp will not be powers like these at all.

32
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:30,600
Alright, listen up. I absolutely will not admit it. There’s no way that guy is that Dision.

33
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:39,767
That was not the Dision I... well, my buddy. He was General’s ace. He was my close friend.

34
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:50,433
My, my.... —it’s someone else. The guy already died somewhere. That was not him.

35
00:04:50,467 --> 00:05:00,500
Therefore—the thing that carries his name, I will without fail, with these hands... eliminate from this world. Without fail——.

36
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:12,100
Since Dision’s uprising, the war situation has been precipitously deteriorating.

37
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:17,767
Taking advantage of the chaos, Neucom is gathering an armada at Megafloat;

38
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,267
at the same time, war plane formations are also also being confirmed.

39
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:30,167
This mission will be to annihilate these war assets. We have deployed the cutting-edge fighter “Game”.

40
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,300
Furthermore, due to the deterioration of the war situation, information from the front lines is complicated;

41
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:40,400
there are concerns that we will be unable to give sufficient support from here on out.

42
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:43,533
Every one of you, we want you to exercise caution.

43
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,033
No matter what it takes, I’ll take that guy out, see if I don’t!

44
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:29,500
Crap!! It’s full of small fry. I won’t even be able to touch him!

45
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,000
If it’s come to this, I have no choice but to compete with you for downs!

46
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,133
Hey now, don’t you crash before me!

47
00:07:04,133 --> 00:08:12,100
Good morning. Is it over? Who built this, and for what purpose...? We only have to get those men involved. Hey-y, that’s enough. WHO ARE YOU? Good morning. Well, you should know this world. WHATd you do to me? Hey now... look. It’s looking this way. In... 30 seconds. WHY? I’M not DEAD yet.... Your copy is starting up over there. Is it over yet? Can you see me? YOU’RE NOT ME. WHO ARE YOU? Can you see me? STOP IT! STOP IT! Can you see me? Run away! Can you see me? Not DEAD yet.... Can you see me? We meet again.

48
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:30,100
What happened!? Fly more carefully!! Do you want to die!?

49
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:26,067
A Neucom armada amassed at Megafloat. Attack these mobile squadrons immediately!

50
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:28,033
Neucom’s military power has been drastically weakened. —a magnificent military feat.

51
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,967
Great stuff! And you beat me in numbers shot down over the course of that battle.

52
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,300
Somehow, it seems I let that dealy with the guy blow my top way too far, too.

53
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:55,967
Thanks to you, I’ve calmed down a bit. But... hey. I’m still going to make sure to settle my score with him.

54
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,800
And that’s it; don’t you forget it.
